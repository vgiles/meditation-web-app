// An app to do some guided breathing, for Emily.
// Require: breathing sound, music, breathe in, breathe out, (x 40), hold (timer), deep breath in, hold (timer 15 seconds)
// Button 1: accumulate presses (1 start breathing to 40, if timer == 40 increment button, 2 to start hold, 3 for breath and hold, 4 to release, modulo 4 I guess)
// Button 2: finish
